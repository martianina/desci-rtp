summary: 'Most data gathered in research is never analyzed, shared, or monetized. DeSci and AI can change that.'

### Researchers gather more data than they can publish. Institutions hoard it. Reuse is rare and hard to track.
With tokenized access and verifiable provenance, DeSci enables a permissioned resale market for long-tail data. AI can clean, process, and propose reanalysis.

### This is not just an economic win. It is scientific efficiency. More learning, fewer trials.
The data exists. The infrastructure to unlock it is what we are building.
