summary: 'Blockchain lets researchers track medicine from protocol to patient, creating transparency in regions most affected by counterfeit drugs.'

### In Sub-Saharan Africa, counterfeit drugs are not a market defect—they are a public health crisis.
DeSci infrastructure can track everything from compound synthesis to patient uptake, using blockchain to verify authenticity and sensor networks to flag breaks in cold chain storage. This restores trust—and saves lives.

### For disease-specific trials and vaccine programs, this creates visibility across international boundaries without losing control of the data.
Blockchain does not just protect intellectual property. It protects people.
