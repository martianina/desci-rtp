summary: 'Edge devices and DeSci infrastructure let trials adapt as data flows—not after the fact.'

### Most trials collect data, then wait months for analysis. But wearables, sensors, and AI allow adaptive designs that adjust in near real time.
DeSci makes this possible by adding consent layers, smart contracts, and auditable data trails—so change does not require bureaucracy.

### A trial that adapts to patient signals can stop early, adjust doses, or pivot focus. That saves time, money, and lives.
Sensors are not new. But the stack that makes them credible is finally here.
