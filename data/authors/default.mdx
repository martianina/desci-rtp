Nina Kilbride is a lawyer, technologist, and systems strategist building the future of science through community, transparency, and open innovation. As the founder of MC1R Ginger Science and DeSci RTP, she brings nearly two decades of experience in law, health data, and decentralized infrastructure to the table.

Her work focuses on creating real-world pathways for scientists, citizens, and founders to participate in shaping research ecosystems â€” starting with underserved populations like redheads, and scaling to global, open networks. She believes DeSci can and should empower individuals to live longer, healthier lives with more agency.

When not building platforms or wrangling regulation, she enjoys tennis, collecting four-leaf clovers, and staying just enough ahead of the future to shape it.
