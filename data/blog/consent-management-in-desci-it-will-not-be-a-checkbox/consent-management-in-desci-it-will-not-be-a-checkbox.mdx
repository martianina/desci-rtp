summary: 'DeSci has to rethink consent—not as a form, but as a protocol.'
---

### Most institutional research treats consent as a formality. DeSci has the opportunity to treat it as a living agreement.
Consent frameworks in decentralized science can be dynamic, revocable, and cryptographically enforced. This shifts the question from 'Did we check the box?' to 'Are we still operating within the participant’s boundaries?'

### That means contributors—especially patients and citizen scientists—gain more control, more clarity, and more recourse.
A checkbox satisfies compliance. DeSci has to build for trust.
