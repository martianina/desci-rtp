summary: 'DeSci cannot operate entirely on L1 chains. Sidechains and rollups will carry the actual load.'

### Most public blockchains were not built to carry research metadata, versioned protocols, or open clinical trial logs.
Sidechains offer scalable throughput, lower fees, and customizable governance layers. For DeSci, they are not just useful—they are foundational.

### Scientific collaboration requires interoperability, modularity, and latency handling. Sidechains make these not just possible, but routine.
If DeSci is going to scale beyond pilot projects, sidechains will be the bridge from concept to global coordination.
