summary: 'Most experiments are not irreproducible because they are wrong. They are irreproducible because no one can read the map.'

### Protocols buried in PDFs. Data in 12 formats. Parameters undocumented. This is not bad science—it is bad formatting.
DeSci allows modular, structured protocol publishing. Inputs, expected outputs, environment, and methods are encoded—not just described.

### With AI-assist and shared standards, replication becomes a technical task, not a political one.
The crisis in reproducibility is a fixable one. The fix starts with code, not review boards.
