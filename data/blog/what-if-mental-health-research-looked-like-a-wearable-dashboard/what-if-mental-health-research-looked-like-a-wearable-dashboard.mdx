### Mental health research is built for endpoints. Life does not work that way.
Wearables, journaling apps, and biometric sensors generate rich data—mostly ignored by institutions. DeSci provides a framework to treat this data as valid, consented research input. AI turns patterns into signals. Blockchain anchors provenance and trust.

### This shifts research from controlled populations to lived experience. The trial becomes ambient, and the participant becomes a collaborator.
Projects like Elata and Cortex are showing what happens when science catches up to how people actually feel.
