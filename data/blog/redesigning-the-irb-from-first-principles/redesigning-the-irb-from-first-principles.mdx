summary: 'IRBs are designed for institutional control. DeSci needs ethical review models built for public coordination.'
---

### Institutional review boards assume slow timelines, centralized control, and a single accountable entity.
DeSci projects are global, modular, and often pseudonymous. That requires a new kind of ethical oversight—one that is transparent, logic-based, and participatory.

### Consent frameworks, public risk assessments, and dispute resolution protocols can all be written into code.
The goal is not to remove oversight. It is to move it to where the science is actually happening.
