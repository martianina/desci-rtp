summary: 'DeSci enables re-analysis of failed compounds, unlocking new use cases from old data.'

### Most failed trials are not failures of science. They are failures of design, endpoints, or funding cycles.
DeSci tools let researchers revisit these datasets with updated protocols, AI-generated hypotheses, and community-led review. What was once abandoned can now be re-validated—or redirected entirely.

### Drug repurposing becomes practical when access is tokenized, data is portable, and incentive models reward iteration.
This is not disruption. It is redemption for science done too early, or under the wrong lens.
