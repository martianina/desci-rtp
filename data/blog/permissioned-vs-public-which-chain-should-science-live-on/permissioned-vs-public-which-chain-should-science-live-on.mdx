summary: 'DeSci needs shared infrastructure—but not all science should live on a public chain.'

### Some research must be permissionless. Some must be protected.
Choosing a blockchain stack for science is not just about speed or gas cost. It is about who has the right to see, verify, and participate in the process.

### Permissioned chains offer privacy and control. Public chains offer transparency and trust. Most DeSci ecosystems will need a hybrid approach: publishing metadata on public rails, with sensitive content gated or sharded appropriately.
The question is not which is better. It is which parts of the stack belong in each.
