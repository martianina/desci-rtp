summary: 'When research is executable code, the boundary between funding and output disappears.'

### Traditional science separates the lab from the ledger. DeSci collapses that divide.
Smart contracts let research proposals encode conditions, milestones, payouts, and ownership—without bureaucracy. A funder can trigger payment when a dataset is posted, or a collaborator can earn a share when they validate a trial result.

### This blurs the line between academic grants and commercial service. It is not always clean—but it is transparent.
Commerce will not corrupt science. It may just keep it moving.
