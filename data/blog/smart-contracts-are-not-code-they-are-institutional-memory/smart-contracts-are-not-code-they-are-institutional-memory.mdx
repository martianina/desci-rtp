### A smart contract is not just a piece of logic—it is a source of record. It documents who promised what, when, and under what terms.
In decentralized science, that kind of memory replaces a lot of meetings. It lets collaborators join or exit without recreating context. It lets projects scale without reinventing the rules.

### It is not just automation. It is shared clarity—preserved and auditable.
Smart contracts are not the solution to governance. But they are a better version of the sticky note and the group chat.
