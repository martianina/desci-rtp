summary: 'Good science needs more than ideas—it needs properly aligned incentives. DeSci offers new ways to reward useful contributions.'

### Institutional science rewards publication volume, not necessarily impact or reproducibility. DeSci flips that script.
With token-based rewards, peer-to-peer funding, and transparent contribution logs, DeSci lets researchers be rewarded for reviewing, replicating, or building on others’ work—not just producing original findings.

### This creates space for slow science, collaborative protocols, and iterative work that does not fit neatly into a journal article.
Incentives matter. DeSci gives us the chance to get them right.
