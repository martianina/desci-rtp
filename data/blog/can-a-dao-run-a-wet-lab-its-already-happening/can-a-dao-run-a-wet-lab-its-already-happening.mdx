### ValleyDAO, VitaDAO, HairDAO—these are not think tanks. They fund, coordinate, and execute lab-based research across continents.
Labs still need scientists. But they no longer need a department. Smart contracts handle milestone logic, wallets handle identity, and Discord handles logistics.

### The tools are messy. But the model is working. And it is replicating.
The question is no longer whether this can scale. It is how much slower we want to move before we join in.
