### AI models consume scientific data—but they rarely verify it. Garbage in, garbage out remains the rule.
DeSci-native publishing, tokenized datasets, and structured metadata standards let researchers create datasets that are verifiable by machines, licensed for reuse, and governed by incentive mechanisms.

### This turns data into a product—not just an artifact—and gives AI agents something credible to build on.
If the next generation of science is AI-assisted, DeSci is what ensures that assistance is reliable.
