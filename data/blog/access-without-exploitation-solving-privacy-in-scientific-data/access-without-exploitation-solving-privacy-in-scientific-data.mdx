summary: 'If DeSci wants to grow, it must offer better data access without repeating the extractive models of Big Tech and Big Academia.'

### Most scientific data is either locked behind paywalls or mined without consent. DeSci can—and must—offer a third path.
By pairing open registries with consent-aware metadata and cryptographic tooling, researchers can request access, prove intent, and log downstream use. The participant stays in the loop.

### Access does not mean extraction. The more DeSci treats data contributors as collaborators—not subjects—the more robust and trusted the system will become.
Privacy is not a compliance problem. It is a trust architecture challenge.
