summary: 'DeSci can simplify reporting and permission—but cannot skip accountability.'

### Smart contracts can enforce disclosure. Version control can track protocol drift. Decentralized IDs can simplify onboarding and IRB coordination.
But DeSci will still need human judgment to navigate jurisdictional complexity, evolving standards, and ethical nuance.

### We can automate logs. We can automate access control. We cannot automate deliberation—or responsibility.
Compliance does not go away in DeSci. It becomes shared, visible, and enforceable in new ways.
