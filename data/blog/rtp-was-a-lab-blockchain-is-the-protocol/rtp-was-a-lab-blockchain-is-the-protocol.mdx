### The Dream in the Pines

In the 1950s, North Carolina was not an obvious candidate for a scientific revolution. It was rural, agrarian, and losing talent fast. But political leaders had a wild idea: what if they could keep researchers in the state—not by building a factory, but by building a forest?

Governor Luther Hodges and, later, Jim Hunt envisioned a corridor between UNC, Duke, and NC State that could house industry, academia, and public health projects under one canopy. They called it Research Triangle Park.

They did not create a product. They created a coordination layer.

### The RTP Model: What Worked

RTP became a proof of concept for regional scientific infrastructure. Stable public-private partnerships. University research feeding into commercial biotech. Quiet, long-term funding structures. A willingness to bet on researchers before there were products to show.

It was exported everywhere: from Boston’s innovation clusters to global spinouts in Singapore, Chile, and Finland. It worked because it created gravity—a place for science to land.

### But the World Changed

Trials became expensive. Timelines bloated. Grant cycles narrowed. Coordination became harder, not easier.

The biggest bottleneck? Payments and participation. Trials only happened in cities with money, data storage, and centralized billing. That meant entire genetic populations were ignored—not because the science was hard, but because the logistics were.

Science became a shipping problem.

### Enter Blockchain—And a Familiar Pattern

Blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized identity are solving the same problems RTP tackled—only this time, the infrastructure is portable.

Researchers do not need co-location. They need coordination. Blockchain offers:

- Global payment rails
- Permissioned data exchange
- Verifiable provenance
- Programmable funding

What RTP did with state-backed land, blockchain is doing with global consensus.

### What We Lost—And What We Can Recover

Entire countries were excluded from research. Whole lineages never sequenced. Pharma could not justify it. The trial would not pay out. The paperwork was too hard.

Now, a trial can be coordinated from a DAO. The drug can be logged on-chain. The data shared with privacy preserved. The payment routed to Kampala, not Cambridge.

This is not disruption. It is return to purpose.

### RTP’s Legacy—and the Next Fork

RTP proved that research could be coordinated. Blockchain proves that coordination does not need real estate.

The next Research Triangle will not be bounded by highways. It will be bounded by smart contracts, wallets, and protocols of trust.

The forest got us here. Now the ledger takes us further.
