summary: 'DeSci is laying the groundwork for data to be owned, shared, verified, and traded. That will change what counts as research.'

### In a verified data marketplace, scientific data is not just archived—it is activated.
Tokens, NFTs, and other primitives let researchers sell access to datasets, license models, or issue stake in future work. If the reputation layer works, buyers know what they are getting. If not, the system collapses.

### The challenge is not just technical. It is philosophical. Are we ready to package raw knowledge as an asset?
The answer will define how far DeSci can scale beyond grants.
