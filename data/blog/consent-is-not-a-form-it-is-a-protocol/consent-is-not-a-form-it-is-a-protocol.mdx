### In traditional research, consent is paperwork. In decentralized research, it becomes an access system.
Smart contracts allow consent to be modular: participants can approve specific data uses, revoke rights mid-study, or set duration and compensation parameters. AI agents can enforce those terms automatically.

### This is not just about privacy. It is about dignity, agency, and trust in scientific collaboration.
Projects like ConsentLayer and EthicsDAO are building consent-as-infrastructure—not compliance theater.
