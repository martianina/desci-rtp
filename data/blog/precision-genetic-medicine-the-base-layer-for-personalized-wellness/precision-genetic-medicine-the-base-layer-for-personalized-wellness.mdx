### MC1R carriers. Lactose persistent genotypes. Pharmacogenomic edge cases. These groups often get excluded from studies—not because the science is lacking, but because the infrastructure is not there.
DeSci protocols enable opt-in registries, smart consent layers, and coordinated funding streams for highly targeted research. AI helps find correlations. Blockchain ensures participation and access rules are followed.

### The dream of personalized medicine is not about sequencing. It is about follow-through. DeSci provides that follow-through.
This is not boutique health. It is infrastructure for the majority of people still considered edge cases.
