summary: 'If posting a dataset costs $40, most scientists will not do it. Gas is not trivial. It is make-or-break for participation.'

### The infrastructure cost of using Ethereum is non-trivial. For scientific publishing, it is often a dealbreaker.
If DeSci wants adoption from real researchers—not just crypto-aligned builders—it must design around cost constraints. Layer 2s, fee batching, and alternative rollups are not optional. They are critical.

### No scientist wants to explain to their lab director why uploading a protocol cost more than a conference flight. If the user experience feels expensive or risky, researchers will walk away.
Gas is not background noise. It is product friction. Solve for it.
