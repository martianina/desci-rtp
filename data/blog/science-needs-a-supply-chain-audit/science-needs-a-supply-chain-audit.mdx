summary: 'From reagents to refrigeration, bad science often begins with a missing item. DeSci can help track the basics.'

### Scientific reproducibility often fails for mundane reasons: mislabeled reagents, expired enzymes, off-spec compounds.
DeSci adds visibility to the black box. Blockchain logs lot numbers, origin, and environmental controls—across geographies and labs. Researchers stop guessing, and protocols get legible.

### This is not just good for reproducibility. It is essential for global collaboration where customs and logistics vary wildly.
Science cannot be trusted if its inputs are invisible.
